# algorithm-design-manual-solutions
Solution to problems from the book "The Algorithm Design Manual" in JavaScript and C/C++.

## Testing JS Solutions

In the directories with test.js file, just ru:

```
node test
```

## Compiling C++ Solutions (GCC)
Bellow is an example compiling solution from chapter 1:

```
cd cpp/chapter1
g++ --std=c++11 test.cpp 1-28-integer-division.cpp
```

If you run the .a.out file 

```
./a.out
```

and get no output, it means that the tests passed and everything is ok!
(rule of silence).
